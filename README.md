# Word Mask

My first taste of bash scripting!

* WHAT: Generate a word mask for github contribution matrix.

* WHY: Try new stuff. My first taste of bash scripting.

* HOW: Simply put words after ./script.sh. Supports multiple words (the github contribution matrix may not fit long series of words and overflow btw). The output is a directory named as "WordMask". Push that directory to the github and all is set. Example:
```bash
./script.sh HELLO WORLD
```

* TIPS: So far only supports Uppercase letters :)
